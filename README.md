RoadNarrows Make System

## Description
The rnmake system provides a fast and simple make system for RoadNarrows LLC
packages.
Each package has a required, but flexible, directory hierarchical structure.

The rnmake system supports both native and cross-compliled target
architectures.

The rnmake system is built around GNU make plus some simple shell (sh/bash)
utilities and the doxygen documentation tools.
